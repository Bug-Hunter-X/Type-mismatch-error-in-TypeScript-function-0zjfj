# Type Mismatch Error in TypeScript

This repository demonstrates a common type mismatch error in TypeScript that occurs when a function expects a certain type of argument but receives an argument of a different type.

## Description
The `greeter` function is defined to take a string argument and return a string. However, the code passes an array of strings to the function, which causes a type mismatch error. The error message will show a detailed explanation of the type mismatch and provide guidance on how to fix it.

## Solution
The solution involves modifying the `greeter` function to accept an array of strings or adjusting the input to the `greeter` function to match the expected type.  This change will resolve the type mismatch error.
